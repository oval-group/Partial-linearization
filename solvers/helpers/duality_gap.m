% Return the SVM duality gap for the implicit primal-dual pair given by

% This function is expensive, as it requires a full decoding pass over all
% examples (so it costs as much as n BCFW iterations). If the duality gap
% is checked regularly as a stopping criterion, then one can also use the
% returned w_s & ell_s quantities to make a batch Frank-Wolfe step and not
% waste this computation (see the update in Alg. 2 in the paper).
